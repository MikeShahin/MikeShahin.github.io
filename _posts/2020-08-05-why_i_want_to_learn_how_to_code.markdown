I went to college for mechanical engineering and worked in the field for a few years. Through that I learned how do do basic programming in objective C and Matlab. They were very useful for collecting test data and creating arduino prototypes. I have always had a thirst for learning and wanted to be able to create my own websites as well as programs for whatever ideas I have. This led me to take a javascript course which I really enjoyed but still wanted more, so with the free time the Covid-19 lockdown provided I decided to take a software programming bootcamp to hopefully learn how to code anything I could ever want. I also live in San Francisco where programming jobs are much more prevalent than mechanical engineering.
