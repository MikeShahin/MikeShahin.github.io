Ever since i started using API's in a javascript course I have fell in love with them. You can get so much information from a single API. In that class I began my journey into API's by using a random joke API to create a very simple website for one of my homework assignments. For one project I used the BBC, EventRegistry, and Newsapi.org API's to create a news feeder website where users can see a list of headlines from the days top news stories and choose a story to read more about it. For my final project in that class I used the Spoonacular API to create a recipe app that lets users see a collection of recipes based on a few different options and keywords.

For my CLI project I initially wanted to make an app that can find protests near your area, but there was no API for that and I could not find a good website to scrape for that kind of data. Through my research I did find a really cool API that tracks police brutality, but this API would be better utilized for a web-page app as is heavily relies on videos and pictures which you can't really do on the command line (or maybe you can and I just haven't figured out how yet?), so I bookmarked it and hope to use for another project.Then I started looking at event API's and landed on Eventful, which lets you search for all kinds of events, including protests! It is very easy to use and can give thousands of results with little input. 

Anyways, I really love using API's and hope to get a chance to use more as the course continues.
