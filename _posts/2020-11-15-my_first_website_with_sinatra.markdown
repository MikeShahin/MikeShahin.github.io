To be honest, I did not like Sinatra all that much. It is very 'clunky' and I found erb files hard to work with. Regardless, I pushe on to create a kick-ass website where users around the world can post protest events for all to see. I got this idea because I have yet to find a single website where you can view all upcoming protests, they are usually spread out between different websites and it also depends on what city/state/country you are in as well. With Protest Tracker, people can find protests all around the world. 

I started building this site with by using Corneal to create the 'skeleton' for my sinatra app, from there I created the models followed by the controllers and views. I got the website running with basic CRUD functionality and then went in to find as many bugs as I could and patched them in the code. I also implemented Sinatra-Flash for error messaging to tell the user when something went wrong or if they are trying to persist bad data/duplicate usernames, etc. 

In the end I believe I created a solid app for my first Sinatra project, hope you enjoy!
